1. who are Pima Indians?

Pima, North American Indians who traditionally lived along the Gila and Salt rivers in Arizona, U.S., in what was the core area of the prehistoric 
Hohokam culture. The Pima, who speak a Uto-Aztecan language and call themselves the “River People,” are usually considered to be the descendants of 
the Hohokam.  

2. What is diabetes ?

Acccording to NIH, "Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main 
source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used 
for energy. 
Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough—or any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells.
Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause health problems. Although diabetes has no cure, you can take steps to manage your 
diabetes and stay healthy.

3. What are the different types of diabetes? 

The most common types of diabetes are type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes.

Type 1 diabetes If you have type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. Your immune system attacks and destroys the cells in your pancreas 
that make insulin. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, although it can appear at any age. People with 
type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day to stay alive.

Type 2 diabetes If you have type 2 diabetes, your body does not make or use insulin well. You can develop type 2 diabetes at any age, even 
during childhood. However, this type of diabetes occurs most often in middle-aged and older people. Type 2 is the most common type of diabetes.

Gestational diabetes Gestational diabetes develops in some women when they are pregnant. Most of the time, this type of diabetes goes away after 
the baby is born. However, if you’ve had gestational diabetes, you have a greater chance of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Sometimes 
diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy is actually type 2 diabetes.

Other types of diabetes Less common types include monogenic diabetes, which is an inherited form of diabetes, and cystic fibrosis-related diabetes .
